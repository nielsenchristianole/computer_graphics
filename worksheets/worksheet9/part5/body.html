    Projection shadows allows for shadows to have the same resolution as the objects displayed. But will not allow for shadows on the same object.

    Shadow mapping allows for shadows to be cast on the same object, but will have a lower resolution than the object displayed. This is because the shadow map is a 2D texture that is used to store the depth values of the scene from the light's perspective. The shadow map is then used to determine if a fragment is in shadow or not.
