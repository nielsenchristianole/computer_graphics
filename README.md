## TODOs:
Fix w6p2 filtering mode
Finish w6p3:
    Spin the globe. The earth texture has high resolution leading to
    minification issues, especially in the mountain ranges during a spin.
    Choose a filtering option that betters these minification issues without
    too much blurring of the texture. **_Explain your choice._**
