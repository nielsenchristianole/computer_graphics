    I used the same camera matrix consisting of a perspective(45.0, 1.0, 0.1, 100.0) and lookAt(vec3(0.5, 0.5, 8), vec3(0.5, 0.5, 0.0), vec3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)) for all three boxes.
    <h3>
        One-point
    </h3>
    I did nothing, as looking at the cube drawn from origo already produces the one point view.

    <h3>
        Two-point
    </h3>
    I translate the cube by two units along the x-axis.

    <h3>
        Three-point
    </h3>
    I translate the cube to have center in origo. Rotate it by 45 degrees around the x-axis. Move it back to origo and then translate it by negative two units along the x-axis.
